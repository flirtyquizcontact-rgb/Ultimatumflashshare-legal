  <!-- ===================== PRIVACY POLICY ===================== -->
  <h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2025-12-21</p>

  <div class="card">
    <p><strong>Summary:</strong> UltimatumFlashShare is designed as an <em>offline-first</em> file transfer app. Your selected files are transferred locally (e.g., via Wi-Fi/LAN) and saved to your device. We do not sell your personal data. We use Google services (AdMob and Firebase) to keep the app sustainable and to improve stability and performance.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>1) Who we are</h3>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how UltimatumFlashShare (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects and uses information when you use the mobile application (“App”).</p>

  <h3>2) Information we collect</h3>
  <h4>2.1 Data you choose to provide</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Files you select:</strong> The App accesses files only when you choose them (e.g., via Android’s system picker/SAF or MediaStore). File transfers occur locally. We do not upload your files to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Support messages:</strong> If you contact us, you may provide your email and message content.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>2.2 Data collected automatically (Google SDKs)</h4>
  <p>The App may use Google Firebase and Google AdMob. Depending on your device settings, consent choices, and configuration, these services may collect:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>App diagnostics:</strong> crash logs, performance data, and related technical information (e.g., device model, OS version, app version) via Firebase Crashlytics / Performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> usage events (e.g., which screens are opened) via Firebase Analytics (if enabled).</li>
    <li><strong>Advertising data:</strong> ad impressions, interactions, and potentially device identifiers such as the Advertising ID for ad delivery and fraud prevention via AdMob (subject to consent and platform restrictions).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>3) How we use information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide core functionality:</strong> enable local file transfer and local file management.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve stability and performance:</strong> detect crashes, fix bugs, and optimize performance (Firebase).</li>
    <li><strong>Show ads (if enabled):</strong> fund development and maintenance through AdMob.</li>
    <li><strong>Security and abuse prevention:</strong> detect abnormal behavior and protect the service integrity.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>4) Data sharing</h3>
  <p>We do not sell personal data. We may share data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google</strong> (Firebase, AdMob) as our service provider to operate analytics, crash reporting, and ads.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal authorities</strong> if required to comply with applicable law.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Google’s use of information is governed by its own policies. You can review Google’s Privacy Policy at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">policies.google.com/privacy</a>.</p>

  <h3>5) Your files & local storage</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Files remain on your device:</strong> transfers are performed locally; the App does not upload your files to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Storage location:</strong> received files may be stored in an app-specific folder (e.g., under <code>Android/data/&lt;package&gt;/files/Download/</code>) unless you export them using “Save As…”.</li>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> the App requests only the permissions needed for the features you use.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>6) Legal bases (EEA/UK)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent:</strong> for personalized ads/analytics where required (e.g., EEA).</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests:</strong> for basic diagnostics and fraud prevention, where permitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Contract/performance:</strong> to provide core app functionality you request.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>7) Children’s privacy</h3>
  <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe a child provided personal data, contact us to request deletion.</p>

  <h3>8) Data retention</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Local files:</strong> remain on your device until you delete them.</li>
    <li><strong>Firebase/AdMob data:</strong> retained according to Google’s settings/policies and our configuration, only as needed for the purposes above.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>9) Security</h3>
  <p>We use reasonable measures to protect information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h3>10) Your choices & rights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Opt-out:</strong> manage ad personalization in device/Google settings; disable analytics where available.</li>
    <li><strong>Requests:</strong> you can request information or deletion of data we control by emailing us.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>11) International transfers</h3>
  <p>Google may process data on servers outside your country. Transfers are handled under Google’s legal mechanisms.</p>

  <h3>12) Changes to this policy</h3>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the updated version here and change the “Effective date”.</p>
